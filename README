DESCRIPTION
    This module allows you to interface to the Elgato EyeTV Digital Video
    Recorder. EyeTV is a piece of software and hardware for Mac OS X which
    can record and play back television much like a Tivo. This module allows
    you to interface to the EyeTV software, view the channel list and the
    recorded programmes and schedule recordings.

    See Mac::EyeTV::Programme for information on scheduling a recording.

    You should create Mac::Glue bindings to EyeTV before using this (along
    the lines of 'sudo gluemac EyeTV').

    The EyeTV software itself is available from Elgato Systems at
    http://www.elgato.com/index.php?file=support_updates_eyetv
